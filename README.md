Steps to run:

Visit http://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/the-ultimate-ethereum-dapp-tutorial

OR
 
1. Git clone this repo.

2. Run npm/yarn install.

3. Install truffle globally - npm install -g truffle. Truffle is a framework for ethereum dapps.

4. Download and install Ganache - http://truffleframework.com/ganache. 
   This will start the local blockchain instance.

5. Install metamask extension for chrome. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en
   It will be used to communicate with the blockchain network. 

6. Run 'truffle migrate --reset'.

7. Run '$ npm run dev'. Point the browser to http://localhost:3000/ if it didn't already.

Things to do:

1. Sign up, Sign in, session management.
2. Removing the vote count from the user screen and showing it in a separate admin screen.
3. Investing in a dapp front-end framework, because integrating contracts into a client-server system introduces complexity.
4. Anything else you can think of :-)
